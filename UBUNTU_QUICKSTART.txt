For convenience, the following steps can be followed with little or no modification under Ubuntu (tested on 13.04). It is assumed that any required dependencies are available (see README.txt for more information).

sudo pip install gdrivefs

# This needs to be in the primary sbin/ directory.
cd /sbin
sudo ln -s `which gdfs` mount.gdfs

Add to /etc/fstab (create /var/cache/gdfs and /mnt/gdrivefs, first):

    /var/cache/gdfs/credcache /mnt/gdrivefs gdfs allow_other 0 0

To get the authorization URL:

    gdfstool auth -u

Visit the given URL, log-in, and grab the resulting code.

sudo gdfstool auth -a /var/cache/gdfs/credcache "<code>"
sudo mount /mnt/gdrivefs/

# To list the root directory:

    ls -l /mnt/gdrivefs/
